# percolation
This is assignment 1 from Coursera course:  Princeton University Algorithms 1 with Robbert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. 

Uses edu.princeton.cs.algs4.WeightedQuickUnionUF from their free library.

My submission got an 84/100, the points missing is mainly due to the backwash issue that I did not resolve. 
However, this backwash does not affect the monty-carlo simulation or runtime.
