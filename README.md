# percolation
This is assignment 1 from Coursera course:  Princeton University Algorithms 1 with Robbert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. 

[Given a composite systems comprised of randomly distributed insulating and metallic materials: what fraction of the materials need to be metallic so that the composite system is an electrical conductor? Given a porous landscape with water on the surface (or oil below), under what conditions will the water be able to drain through to the bottom (or the oil to gush through to the surface)? Scientists have defined an abstract process known as percolation to model such situations.](http://coursera.cs.princeton.edu/algs4/assignments/percolation.html)

My submission got an 84/100, the points missing is mainly due to the backwash issue that I did not resolve. 
However, this backwash does not affect the monty-carlo simulation or runtime.
